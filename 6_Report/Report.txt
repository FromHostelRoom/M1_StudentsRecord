This mini project in C Student Record System has a unique style of coding and is presented in a colorful manner.
It uses files as database to perform file handling operations such as add, search, modify and delete records to
manage students’ records. In this project, you can also generate mark-sheet for students.

Here, a console window is virtually divided into 2 parts – one is static and it does not change, while the other is dynamic and it changes from time to time. The text are coded using various color-related functions to make them static.

The source code for this mini project is error-free, but not complete. There are many places for improvements and enhancements within the project. This C mini project on student record management system is compiled in Code::Blocks IDE using GCC compiler.


Features of Student Record System in C:
Simple functions have been to manipulate data structure and file handling, so here I will just list the features of this project.

Add student record
Search student record
Modify student record
Generate marksheet (also see: student report card system project in C++)
Delete student record
Change password
The functions listed below have been used to produce background with color effects. They are described in the source code with comments.

void SetColor(int ForgC)
void ClearConsoleToColors(int ForgC, int BackC)
void SetColorAndBackground(int ForgC, int BackC
void gotoxy (int x, int y) – This function allows you to print text in any place of screen. Using this function in Code::Blocks requires coding, but it can be directly used in Turbo C. Here is a code for this function in Code::Blocks.
COORD coord = {0, 0};  // sets coordinates to (0,0) as global variables
void gotoxy (int x, int y)
{
        coord.X = x; coord.Y = y; // X and Y are the coordinates
        SetConsoleCursorPosition(GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE), coord);
}
