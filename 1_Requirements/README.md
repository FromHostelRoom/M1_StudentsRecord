        * search_student() :- used to search students.
        * mod_student() :- used to modify students.
        * delete_student() :- used to delete student record.
        * main_window() :- used to provide interface to the project.
        
## 4W's and 1'H
## Who:
Student Record System is used by the Education Industries to store the data of the students. This system is used for any kind of industry whether it be small scale or large scale.
## What:
It is helpful for the organisation in order to save the complete data of each student.
## When:
The Student Record System is now used in every industry to have all the info of the student stored into file/database. This way all the list of student working in a particular iorganization can be stored in one place
## Where:
Face the issues in saving the data of student in school and colleges etc.
## How:
This issue can be solved by creating a database of students and saving the information in a file.

## SYSTEM REQUIREMENT:

                     This section describes the hardware components and software requirements of this mini project:-
                     
                     #Hardware Requirements:
                     1.Processor-2.4HZ
                     2.Memory-   256MB RAM
                     3.Disk Space -50GB
                     
                     #Software Requirements:
                     1.Operating System- Windows 7 and later version && Linux
                     2.Databse System
                     3.Visual Studio Code (latest version)



## SWOT Analysis:

SWOT analysis is a simple yet effective process for identifying positive and negative forces at work that can affect the successful completion of a project. 
SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats. It allows the project leader to assess areas that are working well and areas that need improvement. 
If project management is managing a movement from one state to another, then a SWOT analysis lets a team know where they are currently so they can go where they want to be.
         
         *STRENGTHS:- 
         This project is designed to solve the problems faced during manual entry of students' information.
         The  major  benefit  of  the  system  is  that  it  helps  the  staff  to  accomplish  their  daily  functions  more efficiently, and Limit the use of papers.
         Quick access to the required information as it is only, one click away. It solves the problem of time consuming, since data is centralized. 
         It  also  enhances  security  as  access  to  the  system  requires  authentication.
         The Admin can login into the system and execute any of the available tasks; 
         1. Can edit student information in the database; 
         2. Can make search for a specific student; 
         3. Can access all the details of the student. 
         4. Can view his/her personal details. 
         5. Can upload student’s data.
         6. Generate students transcripts 
         
         *WEAKNESS:-
         Some of the common Weaknesses are-
         1.This  means  that  only authorized users can access that system.
         2.The system is not web based therefore the user should create a backup somewhere else for security purpose.
         3.The institution administration finds it tiresome and time consuming when entering students details for every department.
         
         *OPPORTUNITY:-
         In this digital era of technology this project is having a greater opportunity to sustain in market as a project.
         These days there are many schools and colleges following the old fashion of maintainging registers for students details. By using this model
         we can eleminate the traditional method of recording students details.
         In coming days, there are huge opportunity of this when schools and colleges will transform digitally.
         
         *THREATS:-
         1.Vulnerable as anti virus system not installed.
         2.The system is not web based therefore the user should create a backup somewhere else for security purpose.
         
         
## Best Methods To Be Followed

* Used functions to decrease dependency on main function
* Used structures and arrays to accept the inputs from user and store the values which helped in creating easy design of Student Record system.
* Printf statements have been placed only wherever necessary to avoid confusions
* Created header file so that the fuctions can be used else where ever required without any difficulty
* Unit testing is done to avoid any computational errors.  

    
## Technology Used:-

Technologies Used visual studio code  and  c programming  language  are  used  to  create  the  interface  which allows the front end user to interact freely with the system.
