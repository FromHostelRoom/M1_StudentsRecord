##SYSTEM REQUIREMENT:
                     This section describes the hardware components and software requirements of this mini project:-
                     
                     #Hardware Requirements:
                     1.Processor-2.4HZ
                     2.Memory-   256MB RAM
                     3.Disk Space -50GB
                     
                     #Software Requirements:
                     1.Operating System- Windows 7 and later version && Linux
                     2.Databse System
                     3.Visual Studio Code (latest version)



##SWOT Analysis:
SWOT analysis is a simple yet effective process for identifying positive and negative forces at work that can affect the successful completion of a project. 
SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats. It allows the project leader to assess areas that are working well and areas that need improvement. 
If project management is managing a movement from one state to another, then a SWOT analysis lets a team know where they are currently so they can go where they want to be.
         
         *STRENGTHS:- 
         This project is designed to solve the problems faced during manual entry of students' information.
         The  major  benefit  of  the  system  is  that  it  helps  the  staff  to  accomplish  their  daily  functions  more efficiently, and Limit the use of papers.
         Quick access to the required information as it is only, one click away. It solves the problem of time consuming, since data is centralized. 
         It  also  enhances  security  as  access  to  the  system  requires  authentication.
         The Admin can login into the system and execute any of the available tasks; 
         1. Can edit student information in the database; 
         2. Can make search for a specific student; 
         3. Can access all the details of the student. 
         4. Can view his/her personal details. 
         5. Can upload student’s data.
         6. Generate students transcripts 
         
         *WEAKNESS:-
         Some of the common Weaknesses are-
         1.This  means  that  only authorized users can access that system.
         2.The system is not web based therefore the user should create a backup somewhere else for security purpose.
         3.The institution administration finds it tiresome and time consuming when entering students details for every department.
         
         *OPPORTUNITY:-
         In this digital era of technology this project is having a greater opportunity to sustain in market as a project.
         These days there are many schools and colleges following the old fashion of maintainging registers for students details. By using this model
         we can eleminate the traditional method of recording students details.
         In coming days, there are huge opportunity of this when schools and colleges will transform digitally.
         
         *THREATS:-
         1.Vulnerable as anti virus system not installed.
         2.The system is not web based therefore the user should create a backup somewhere else for security purpose.
         
         
         
##Technology Used:-
Technologies Used visual studio code  and  c programming  language  are  used  to  create  the  interface  which allows the front end user to interact freely with the system.
